# Expo ImagePicker: Inconsistent or Invalid Image URI Returned

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo ImagePicker library.  The selected image's URI is sometimes returned incorrectly, resulting in issues when attempting to display or process the image.

## Bug Description
After selecting an image using Expo ImagePicker, the returned URI may be invalid or inaccessible.  This frequently leads to errors like 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'uri')' when trying to use the image. The problem seems to be more prevalent on Android devices and appears intermittently.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app on both iOS and Android simulators/devices.
3. Select an image using the ImagePicker.
4. Observe that the image may not display correctly or that an error is thrown.  The frequency of this error may vary.

## Solution
The provided solution involves adding checks to validate the URI and handle potential errors more robustly.  This involves checking for the existence of the URI, checking the file extension, and adding error handling.
