This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library.  The issue is that after selecting an image, the image URI returned by the library may be incorrect or not accessible, leading to errors when attempting to display or use the selected image.  This often manifests as a blank image or an error message like 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'uri')'.  The problem seems to be intermittent and platform-specific (more frequent on Android).
